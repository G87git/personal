## Updates

### Dev Update â€” July 6th, 2023 ðŸ¥°
I've immigrated to the UK as a skilled worker and now live in Birmingham. After much unpacking and settling in with my toddlers, I'm aiming to resume theme development in a few months. Webflow's new React component export tool is intriguing, and I might shift component design and management there for easier use by marketing teams and visual designers.

### Dev Update â€” Feb 13th, 2023 [Updated: March 05th, 2023]
Jest is set up, but I haven't started building tests due to a busy schedule.

### Dev Update â€” Feb 10th, 2023
I'm taking a short break from theme development as I finalize a job search and prepare to move to a larger home for my growing family. I hope to continue development by the end of next quarter.

## Website Development Progress ðŸ¥³
The portfolio app is in the Beta phase and ready for forking if you're familiar with React and Next.js. The next release will focus on improving developer experience by transitioning from local JSON to MongoDB, setting up Sanity for GUI page editing, adding unit testing with Jest, incorporating TypeScript, and more.
